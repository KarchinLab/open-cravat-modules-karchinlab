Assessment of allele frequencies in different populations is a crucial step for clinical variant classification and novel disease gene discovery. The All of Us Research Program (All of Us) aims to build a diverse biobank to accelerate precision medicine research with data from >1 million Americans from diverse backgrounds. This includes sequencing participants' genomes to advance our understanding of genetic variation from individuals of non-European-like genetic ancestry. This annotator provides the All of Us 250k variant allele frequency data.
