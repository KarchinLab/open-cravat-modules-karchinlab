# ALoFT: Annotation of Loss-of-Function Transcripts

ALoFT provides extensive annotations to putative loss-of-function variants (LoF) in protein-coding genes including functional, evolutionary and network features. Further, ALoFT can predict the impact of premature stop variants and classify them as dominant disease-causing, recessive disease-causing and benign variants.
