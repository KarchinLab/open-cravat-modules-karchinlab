# BRCA1 Functional Assay: database providing accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants in BRCA1
BRCA1 Functional Assay uses the results of the characterization of the effects of 1056 amino acid substitions in the first 192 residues of BRCA1 to compare against variants with known effects on DNA repair function or cancer predispostion (particularly breast and ovarian cancer). The database provides accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants allowing functional characterization of BRCA1 missense variants at scale.
