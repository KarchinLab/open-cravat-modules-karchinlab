# BRCA1 Functional Assay: 
Function scores for 3,893 SNVs located within or near the thirteen exons that encode for the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1 (exons 2-5 and 15-23, respectively). Function scores quantify the depletion of SNVs, and are log2-scaled such that the median synonymous SNV scores as 0. More negative function scores are indicative of loss-of-function variants; the median nonsense SNV scored -2.12. Each SNV was placed into one of three broad functional classes based on its function score: 'functional'/'FUNC' (score > -0.748, 72.5%), 'intermediate'/'INT' ( -0.748 > score > -1.328, 6.4%), and 'non-functional'/'LOF' (score < -1.328, 21.1%).
