  desc: If the score is negative it is likely to be observed vs a positive score is likely to be simulated, and therefore more likely to have deleterious effects.

  title: Phred
  type: float
  desc: phred-like scores ("scaled C-scores") range from 1 to 99, based on the rank of each variant relative to all possible 8.6 billion substitutions in the human reference genome. A scaled score of 10, for example, refers to the top 10% of all reference genome SNVs.
description: CADD is a tool for scoring the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants in the human genome.
