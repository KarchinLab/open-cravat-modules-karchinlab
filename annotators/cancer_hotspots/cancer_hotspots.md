# Cancer Hotspots

 Our systematic computational, experimental, and clinical analysis of hotspot mutations in ~25,000 human cancers demonstrates that the long right tail of biologically and therapeutically significant mutant alleles is still incompletely characterized. Sharing prospective genomic data will accelerate hotspot identification, thereby expanding the reach of precision oncology in cancer patients

## Methods

To identify novel hotspot mutations of biological and potentially therapeutic importance, we analyzed somatic mutational data from 24,592 patients. This cohort consisted of 14,256 retrospectively sequenced predominantly primary untreated human cancers and 10,336 prospectively sequenced active, advanced cancer patients with recurrent and metastatic disease (43% of specimens were obtained from metastatic sites) (8). These samples represent 322 cancer types spanning 32 organ sites, the annotation of which was standardized to conform to an open-source structured disease classification (http://oncotree.mskcc.org/). We analyzed each of the 32 organ sites independently as well as the full cohort (pan-cancer) to enhance the probability of identifying hotspots that occur rarely in multiple organ types of different mutational burdens and processes(9). To do this, organ type-specific, gene-specific, and context-specific background mutation rates were computed. We also developed a first-of-its-kind computational approach to identify hotspots of candidate oncogenic small in-frame insertions or deletions, which are more challenging to identify than substitutions due to the variability of mutant allele length and position from tumor to tumor.
