output_columns:
- name: pct
  title: Percentile
  type: float
  width: 75
  desc: Percentile ranges from 90 to 100. 100 represents complete constraint, the
    highest constrained region in the model.
- name: syn_density
  title: Synonymous Variant Density
  type: float
  width: 80
  desc: A calculation of the synonymous variant density of the CCR region. Used variants
    that were SNPs and did not change amino acids or stop/start codons. Allowed multiple
    alleles at same bp.
  hidden: true
- name: cpg
  title: CpG
  type: float
  width: 75
  desc: CpG dinucleotide density of the whole CCR region.
  hidden: true
- name: cov_score
  title: Score
  type: float
  width: 75
  desc: The score of length scaled by coverage proportion at 10x for each base pair.
- name: resid
  title: Raw Residual Value
  type: float
  width: 75
  desc: Raw residual value from the linear regression model.
  hidden: true
- name: resid_pct
  title: Raw Residual Percentile
  type: float
  width: 75
  desc: Raw residual percentile, not weighted by proportion of exome represented.
  hidden: true
