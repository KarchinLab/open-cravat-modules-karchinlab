# CEDAR

The Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR) is a freely available resource funded by NCI. It catalogs experimental data on antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human primates, and other animal species in the context of cancer disease. CEDAR also hosts tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of cancer epitopes. CEDAR is a companion site to the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), which is funded by NIAID, and houses epitope data on infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity and transplantation.

Built in collaboration with the CEDAR team, this annotators allows querying the CEDAR epitope database by genomic change. Results are returned when a genomic change is predicted to result in an epitope found in CEDAR.
