It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment."	https://civicdb.org/links/variant/12	"Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer, Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma, Cancer, Cholangiocarcinoma, Clear Cell Sarcoma, Colon Cancer, Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Colorectal Cancer, Ganglioglioma, Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumor, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Hairy Cell Leukemia, Histiocytoma, Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Malignant Conjunctival Melanoma, Malignant Glioma, Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor, Melanoma, Multiple Myeloma, Myeloma, Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Ovarian Cancer, Ovarian Cystadenocarcinoma, Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, Pilocytic Astrocytoma, Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma, Skin Melanoma, Thyroid Cancer, Thyroid Carcinoma"	1	s3	civic001

PTEN loss may sensitize cells to PI3K-mTOR inhibition. While still being debated, there is data to support that PTEN loss is both associated with poorer prognosis, and no change in prognosis."	https://civicdb.org/links/variant/110	"Breast Cancer, Glioblastoma Multiforme"	1	s4	civic002

Of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers, over half harbor this mutation. Meta-analyses have shown that patients harboring this mutation may have worse overall survival, but other studies have shown no difference between H1047R and other PIK3CA mutants from a prognostic standpoint. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for this particular mutation are still in early clinical trial phases."	https://civicdb.org/links/variant/107	"Breast Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Head And Neck Cancer, Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Thyroid Cancer"	1	s5	civic003
