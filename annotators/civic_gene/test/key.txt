BRAF	1	MIS	MIS(1)	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.	https://civicdb.org/links/gene/5
PTEN	1	STG	STG(1)	PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor that is very commonly lost in human cancer. Observed in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, endometrial, lung and breast cancer to varying degrees. Up to 70% of prostate cancer patients have been observed to have loss of expression of the gene. It is a part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and mTOR inhibitors have been relatively ineffective in treating patients with PTEN loss. New appoaches using microRNAs are currently being investigated.	https://civicdb.org/links/gene/41
PIK3CA	1	MIS	MIS(1)	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.	https://civicdb.org/links/gene/37
