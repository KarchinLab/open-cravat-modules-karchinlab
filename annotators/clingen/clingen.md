# Get Started With ClinGen

Funded in 2013 by the National Human Genome Research Institute, ClinGen is a growing collaborative effort, involving three grants, nine principal investigators and over 970 contributors from more than 29 countries. Explore our website to get to know our working groups, learn more about how we are meeting our goals and search our knowledge base.

# What is ClinGen

While knowledge in the field of human genetics has greatly increased since the time of the Human Genome Project, we are still learning all of the ways in which changes in our DNA contribute to human health and disease. The Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, is a National Institutes of Health funded initiative to increase the communityâ€™s knowledge about the relationship between genes and health. We are dedicated to building a knowledge base that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. We do this by first encouraging the sharing of genetic and health data by our key stakeholder groups: patients, clinicians, laboratories, and researchers.

We then use this data to answer a number of key curation questions:

Is this gene associated with a disease, and by which mechanisms do variation cause this disease?
Is this variant causative?
Will this information affect medical management?
Once we answer these questions via our various curation efforts, we make this information publicly available, building a genomic knowledge base with the goal of improving patient care through genomic medicine.

## Gene-Disease Validity

Our curators review genetic and experimental data in the scientific literature to identify genes in which pathogenic variants cause disease.
Laboratories may use this type of information when deciding which genes to include in clinical testing panels.
Clinicians may use this type of information when interpreting test results for their patients.
