# ClinGen Allele Registry

The ClinGen Allele Registry provides a canonical identifier for human genetic variants. The Allele Registry allows cross‚Äêreferencing information about variants across major databases by collating alternate variant identifiers.ClinGen is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building an authoritative central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. One of the key goals of ClinGen is to implement an evidence-based consensus for curating genes and variants. For more information on the ClinGen resource, please visit the ClinGen portal at [clinicalgenome.org](http://clinicalgenome.org)

This annotator calls the ClinGen Allele Registry API for each variant, and requires an active internet connection to run.
