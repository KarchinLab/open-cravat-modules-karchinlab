This variant segregated with disease in 7 affected individuals (PP1_Strong; PMID:7848441; Partners LMM ClinVar SCV000059421.5). This variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; http://exac.broadinstitute.org). This variant lies in the head region of the protein (aa 181-937) and missense variants in this region are statistically more likely to be disease-associated (PM1; PMID:27532257). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that this variant may impact the protein (PP3). A different pathogenic missense variant has been previously identified at this codon which may indicate that this residue is critical to the function of the protein (PM5; c.2155C>T p.Arg719Trp ClinVar Variation ID 14104). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in an autosomal dominant manner.

This  frameshift variant is in exon 11 where it creates a premature stop codon, which is predicted to result in NMD and is absent from population databases. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PVS1 and PM2.	chr12	102843668	-	A

However, it is located within the nonsense mediated decay resistance region upstream of c.2506G>T (p.Glu836*) (PVS1_Strong). The variant is absent in the gnomAD cohort (PM2; http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). This variant has been reported in at least 4 families meeting HDGC clinical criteria (PS4; PMID 17545690). This variant was also found to co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members, with 3 or 4 meioses observed (PP1; PMID: 17545690). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic based on the ACMG/AMP criteria applied as specified by the CDH1 Variant Curation Expert Panel: PVS1_Strong, PM2, PS4, PP1.	chr16	68829756	C	-

In-vitro studies show absent integrin expression on the cell surface (PMID: 15748238). At least 5 individuals including a sibling pair with this variant have been reported in the literature. In summary, based on the evidence available at this time, the variant is classified as pathogenic.

BH4 disorders ruled out. (PMID:2574002); PS3: <3% (PMID:9450897). PM3: Detected in trans with known pathogenic variants. In summary this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for phenylketonuria in an autosomal recessive manner based on the ACMG/AMP criteria applied as specified by the PAH Expert Panel: (PM2, PM3, PP4_Moderate, PS3).

This variant is a synonymous (silent) variant at a nucleotide that is not highly conserved and is not predicted to impact splicing (BP7). The filtering allele frequency of the c.1108+9_1108+21del variant in the RAF1 gene is 0.0637% (54/66698) for European (Non-Finnish) chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which is a high enough frequency to be classified as benign based on thresholds defined by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel for autosomal dominant RASopathy variants (BA1). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as benign. RASopathy-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied (PMID:29493581): BA1, BP5, BP7.	chr3	12599673	GGAGGGCCCCAAG	-

The variant was also found in a French proband with classic PKU in trans with the p.Pro281Leu variant, which has been classified as a VUS per internal PAH ClinGen Working Group classification (see PAH0660); the paper does not state whether BH4 deficiency was excluded (PMID: 26666653). The variant was also found in 1 Caucasian proband with classic PKU, in trans with the known pathogenic c.1066-11G>A variant (PMID: 23430918); BH4 deficiency was excluded via biochemical testing per the recruiting study protocol (PMID: 17846916). Finally, it was found in three Southern German probands with classic PKU; no further details regarding genotype and/or exclusion of BH4 deficiency were given (PMID: 12655553). Thus, PP4_Moderate and PM3 apply per the report in PMID: 17846916.  The sequence change results in a frameshift variant which occurs in exon 3 of 13 in the in the canonical transcript of PAH, a gene fulfilling the most recent criteria for LOF being a known disease mechanism (see PMID: 30192042) (PVS1). It is absent from control databases including ethnically matched individuals, including gnomAD/ExAC, 1000 Genomes, and ESP (PM2). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PVS1, PM2, PM3, PP4_Moderate.	chr12	102894821	-	C
