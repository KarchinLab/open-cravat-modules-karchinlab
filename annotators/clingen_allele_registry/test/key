This variant segregated with disease in 7 affected individuals (PP1_Strong; PMID:7848441; Partners LMM ClinVar SCV000059421.5). This variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; http://exac.broadinstitute.org). This variant lies in the head region of the protein (aa 181-937) and missense variants in this region are statistically more likely to be disease-associated (PM1; PMID:27532257). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that this variant may impact the protein (PP3). A different pathogenic missense variant has been previously identified at this codon which may indicate that this residue is critical to the function of the protein (PM5; c.2155C>T p.Arg719Trp ClinVar Variation ID 14104). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in an autosomal dominant manner.

This  frameshift variant is in exon 11 where it creates a premature stop codon, which is predicted to result in NMD and is absent from population databases. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PVS1 and PM2.	chr12	102843668	-	A

However, it is located within the nonsense mediated decay resistance region upstream of c.2506G>T (p.Glu836*) (PVS1_Strong). The variant is absent in the gnomAD cohort (PM2; http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). This variant has been reported in at least 4 families meeting HDGC clinical criteria (PS4; PMID 17545690). This variant was also found to co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members, with 3 or 4 meioses observed (PP1; PMID: 17545690). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic based on the ACMG/AMP criteria applied as specified by the CDH1 Variant Curation Expert Panel: PVS1_Strong, PM2, PS4, PP1.	chr16	68829756	C	-

In-vitro studies show absent integrin expression on the cell surface (PMID: 15748238). At least 5 individuals including a sibling pair with this variant have been reported in the literature. In summary, based on the evidence available at this time, the variant is classified as pathogenic.
