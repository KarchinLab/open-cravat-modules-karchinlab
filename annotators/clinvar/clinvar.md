# ClinVar: public archive of interpretations of clinically relevant variants
ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation.

Clinical Significance:
1. Benign: As recommended by ACMG/AMP for variants interpreted for Mendelian disorders.
2. Likely benign: As recommended by ACMG/AMP for variants interpreted for Mendelian disorders.
3. Uncertain significance: As recommended by ACMG/AMP for variants interpreted for Mendelian disorders.
4. Likely pathogenic: As recommended by ACMG/AMP for variants interpreted for Mendelian disorders.
5. Pathogenic: As recommended by ACMG/AMP for variants interpreted for Mendelian disorders. Variants that have low penetrance may be submitted as "Pathogenic"; please also include information about the penetrance in a "Comment on clinical significance".
6. Drug response: A general term for a variant that affects a drug response, not a disease. We anticipate adding more specific drug response terms based on a recommendation by CPIC.
7. Association: For variants identified in a GWAS study and further interpreted for their clinical significance.
8. Risk factor: For variants that are interpreted not to cause a disorder but to increase the risk.
9. Protective: For variants that decrease the risk of a disorder, including infections.
10. Affects: For variants that cause a non-disease phenotype, such as lactose intolerance.
11. Conflicting data from submitters: Only for submissions from a consortium, where groups within the consortium have conflicting intepretations of a variant but provide a single submission to ClinVar.
12. Other: If ClinVar does not have the appropriate term for your submission, we ask that you submit "other" as clinical significance and contact us to discuss if there are other terms we should add.
13. Not provided: For submissions without an interpretation of clinical significance.

Review Status is the level of review supporting the assertion of clinical significance for the variation. There are 8 different statuses to consider, ranked from highest to lowest levels of review:
1. Practice Guideline: Information is reviewed by the ClinGen Steering Committee to make the determination of practice guideline status for clinical assertions in ClinVar.
2. Reviewed by expert panel
3. Criteria provided, multiple submitters, no conflicts: Two or more submitters with assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact) provided the same interpretation.
4. Criteria provided, conflicting interpretations: Multiple submitters provided assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact) but there are conflicting interpretations. The independent values are enumerated for clinical significance.
5. Criteria provided, single submitter: One submitter provided an interpretation with assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact).
6. No assertion for the individual variant: The allele was not interpreted directly in any submission; it was submitted to ClinVar only as a component of a haplotype or a genotype.
7. No assertion criteria provided: The allele was included in a submission with an interpretation but without assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact).
8. No assertion provided: The allele was included in a submission that did not provide an interpretation.
