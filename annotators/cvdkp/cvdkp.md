# Cardiovascular Disease Knowledge Portal 

The Cardiovascular Disease Knowledge Portal enables browsing, searching, and analysis of human genetic information linked to myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and related traits, while protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the underlying data.

## The Knowledge Portal Framework

The Cardiovascular Disease Knowledge Portal (CVDKP) framework is being developed by a team of scientists and software engineers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Data in the CVDKP were generated by the Atrial Fibrillation Consortium (AFGen), the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC), the Heart Failure Molecular Epidemiology for Therapeutic Targets consortium (HERMES), the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen), and the CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D Consortium. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients while reducing the time and cost of developing them, by jointly identifying and validating promising biological targets for several diseases, including type 2 diabetes.
