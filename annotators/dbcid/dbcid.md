# dbCID: Database of Cancer Driver InDels

While recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of a multitude of databases in cancer genomic, there is no comprehensive database focusing on the annotation of driver indel yet. Therefore, we created the dbCID which is a collection of known indels that likely to be engaged in cancer development, progression or therapy. It currently contains experimentally supported and putative driver indels derived from manual curation of literature. For each indel, we have curated the position information (genomic, coding DNA, and protein levels), specific diseases, drug sensitivity information (partial) as well as evidence sentences. Evidence information is classified using the levels and rules of Evidence System. The database can be used to improve the training of prediction algorithms and evaluate the methods for predicting the effects of variations.

# Rules for InDel Entry

1. Induced development, recurrence or metastasis of cancer.
2. Associated with increased sensitivity or resistance to a drug.
3. Induced change of function of gene product significantly.
4. Had a higher recurrence frequency in cancer patients compared to the case of healthy controls.
5. Located in an important region in gene or protein, such as a binding or catalytic site.
