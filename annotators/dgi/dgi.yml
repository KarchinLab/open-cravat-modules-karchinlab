- name: category
  title: Gene Category
  type: string
  width: 100
  desc: Gene categories in DGIdb refers to a set of genes belonging to a group that is deemed to be potentially druggable.
  hidden: true
- name: interaction
  title: Interaction Type
  type: string
  width: 75
  category: single

- name: score
  title: Interaction Score
  type: float
  width: 70
  desc: A higher score indicates that there is a greater interaction between the drug and the gene. The score depends on numbers of drug and gene partners, as well as number of supporting publications and sources.
