description: DIDA is a novel database that provides for the first time detailed information on genes 
              and associated genetic variants involved in digenic diseases, the simplest form of oligogenic inheritance.

  desc: True Digenic indicates mutations at both loci are required for disease, mutations at one of the two loci result in no phenotype. Composite
          indicates a variant in one gene is enough to develop the disease but carrying a second one on another gene impacts the disease 
          phenotype or affects the severity or age of onset.

  title: Gene Relationship
  type: string
  width: 120
  hidden: true
  desc: Digenic diseases are caused by mutations in two genes which often have a physical or functional relationship. 
          For each digenic combination in DIDA we determined the relationship between the two genes carring the mutations.
