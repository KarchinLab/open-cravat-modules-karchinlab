# GERP++: Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling
GERP++ identifies constrained elements in multiple alignments by quantifying substitution deficits. These deficits represent substitutions that would have occurred if the element were neutral DNA, but did not occur because the element has been under functional constraint. We refer to these deficits as "Rejected Substitutions" (RS).
