# Gene Haploinsufficiency Score (GHIS): gene haploinsufficiency scoring
GHIS is a database providing haploinsufficiency scores derived from a combination of unbiased large-scale high-throughput datasets, including gene co-expression and genetic variation in over 6000 human exomes. These scores can readily be used to prioritize gene disruptions resulting from any genetic variant, including copy number variants, indels and single-nucleotide variants.
