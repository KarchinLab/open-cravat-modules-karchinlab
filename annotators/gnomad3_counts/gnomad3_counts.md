# gnomAD - genome Aggregation Database

The Genome Aggregation Database is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators, with the goal of aggregating and harmonizing both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and making summary data available for the wider scientific community.

The v3.1 short variant data set provided on this website spans 76,156 genomes from unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies, and is aligned against the GRCh38 reference. In this release, we have included more than 3,000 new samples specifically chosen to increase the ancestral diversity of the resource. As a result, this is the first release for which we have a designated population label for samples of Middle Eastern ancestry. See the [gnomAD v3.1 blog post](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2020-10-gnomad-v3-1-new-content-methods-annotations-and-data-availability/) for details of the latest release.
