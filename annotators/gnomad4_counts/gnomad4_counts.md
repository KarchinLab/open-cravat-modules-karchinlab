# gnomAD - genome Aggregation Database

The Genome Aggregation Database is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators, with the goal of aggregating and harmonizing both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and making summary data available for the wider scientific community.

Full genome Allele Frequency (AF), Allele Number (AN), Allele Count (AC), and Alt Homozygote Count coverage for SNPs and InDels in many populations.
