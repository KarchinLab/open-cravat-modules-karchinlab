# Grantham Scores

Grantham score is a simple attempt at variant effect prediction, based on physicochemical similarity between amino acids. Scores range from 5 to 215, with lower scores indicating a more similar substitution. 

This annotator was built with the precomputed table available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid_replacement#Grantham's_distance).
