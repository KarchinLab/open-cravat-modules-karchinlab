# GTEx: Genotype-Tissue Expression
The GTEx database provides correlations between genotype and tissue-specific gene expression levels that help identify regions of the genome that influence whether and how much a gene is expressed. By analyzing global RNA expression within individual tissues and treating the expression levels of genes as quantitative traits, variations in gene expression that are highly correlated with genetic variation can be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs.
