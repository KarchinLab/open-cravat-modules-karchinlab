output_columns:
- name: disease
  title: Disease/Trait
  type: string
  width: 120
  desc: Disease or Trait examined in study
- name: or_beta
  title: Odds Ratio/Beta Coeff
  type: float
  hidden: true
  width: 75
  desc: Reported odds ratio or beta-coefficient associated with strongest SNP risk allele. Note that prior to 2021, any OR <1 was inverted, along with the reported allele, so that all ORs included in the Catalog were >1. This is no longer done, meaning that associations added after 2021 may have OR <1. Appropriate unit and increase/decrease are included for beta coefficients.
- name: pval
  title: P-value
  type: float
  hidden: true
  desc: Reported p-value for strongest SNP risk allele (linked to dbGaP Association Browser). Note that p-values are rounded to 1 significant digit (for example, a published p-value of 4.8 x 10-7 is rounded to 5 x 10-7).
- name: pmid
  title: PMID
  type: string
  link_format: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/${.*}
  hidden: true
  width: 65
  desc: Pubmed link of the published study
- name: init_samp
  title: Initial Sample
  type: string
  hidden: true
  width: 70
  desc: Sample size and ancestry description for stage 1 of GWAS (summing across multiple Stage 1 populations, if applicable)
- name: rep_samp
  title: Replication Sample
  type: string
  hidden: true
  width: 70
  desc: Sample size and ancestry description for subsequent replication(s) (summing across multiple populations, if applicable)
- name: risk_allele
  title: Risk Allele
  type: string
  hidden: true
  desc: Allele most strongly associated with trait (? for unknown risk allele)
- name: ci
  title: Confidence Interval
  type: string
  hidden: true
  width: 75
  desc: Reported 95% confidence interval associated with strongest SNP risk allele, along with unit in the case of beta-coefficients. If 95% CIs are not published, we estimate these using the standard error, where available.
- name: risk_allele_match
  title: Risk Allele Match
  type: string
  hidden: true
  width: 75
  desc: GWAS catalog is organized by SNP, with the highest risk allele identified. This field is True if the risk allele matches *either* the input reference or alternate allele for any matching GWAS study.

release-note:
  2025.07.02: Annotator rebuild with new monthly auto-updater. Add 'All Annotations' column that includes multiple rows when an input variant. Add 'Risk Allele Match' column to indicate if the input variant matches the risk allele for any matching study.
