# HaploReg American

HaploReg is a tool for exploring annotations of the noncoding genome at variants on haplotype blocks,
such as candidate regulatory SNPs at disease-associated loci. Using LD information from the 1000 
Genomes Project, linked SNPS can be found. HaploReg is designed for researchers developing mechanistic 
hypotheses of the impact of non-coding variants on clinical phenotypes and normal variation.

This version of HaploReg will return SNPS linked to the target variant in American populations.
