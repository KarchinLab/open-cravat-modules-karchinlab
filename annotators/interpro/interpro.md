# InterPro: Protein sequence analysis & classification
InterPro provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. We combine protein signatures from a number of member databases into a single searchable resource, capitalising on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool.

NOTE: Data provided by [dbNSFP](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP) version 4.0b1

1. Domain: The domain or conserved site on which the variant is located. The number in the brackets following a specific domain is the count of times InterPro assigns the variant position to that domain, typically coming from different predicting databases. Multiple entries are separated by ";".
