# Promoter-interacting regions from Javierre et al

Promoter capture Hi-C was used to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters that are significantly associated across 17 human primary hematopoietic cell types. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes.
