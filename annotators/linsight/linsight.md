LINSIGHT is a statistical model for estimating negative selection on noncoding sequences in the human genome. The LINSIGHT score measures the probability of negative selection on noncoding sites which can be used to prioritize SNVs associated with genetic diseases or quantify evolutionary constraint on regulatory sequences, e.g., enhancers or promoters.

LINSIGHT can be viewed as a generalized linear model with an objective function derived from the INSIGHT evolutionary model. Given a set of genomic features, LINSIGHT seeks a linear combination of these features to best explain the signatures of negative selection in the human lineage. More specifically, if a noncoding site is under negative selection, it will be less likely to have a substitution or SNV in the human lineage. In addition, even if we see a SNV at the site, it will tend to segregate at low frequency because of selection. By combining the idea of generalized linear model and the INSIGHT likelihood function, LINSIGHT implicitly aggregates the very weak signatures of natural selection across millions of noncoding sites in the human genome to obtain accurate, high resolution estimate of evolutionary constraint. More detail can be found in the LINSIGHT manuscript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/15/069682).
