# MetaRNN

MetaRNN is a pathogenicity prediction score for human nonsynonymous SNVs (nsSNVs). It integrates information from 28 high-level annotation scores (16 functional prediction scores including SIFT, Polyphen2_HDIV, Polyphen2_HVAR, MutationAssessor, PROVEAN, VEST4, M-CAP, REVEL, MutPred, MVP, PrimateAI, DEOGEN2, CADD, fathmm-XF, Eigen and GenoCanyon, 8 conservation scores including GERP, phyloP100way_vertebrate, phyloP30way_mammalian, phyloP17way_primate, phastCons100way_vertebrate, phastCons30way_mammalian, phastCons17way_primate and SiPhy, and 4 allele frequency information from the 1000 Genomes Project, ExAC, gnomAD exome, and gnomAD genome) to produce an ensemble prediction model with a deep recurrent neural network (RNN). The final prediction is the likelihood of a nsSNV being pathogenic.
