# miRBase: The MicroRNA Database

miRBase provides the following services:
* The miRBase database is a searchable database of published miRNA sequences and annotation. Each entry in the miRBase Sequence database represents a predicted hairpin portion of a miRNA transcript (termed mir in the database), with information on the location and sequence of the mature miRNA sequence (termed miR). Both hairpin and mature sequences are available for searching and browsing, and entries can also be retrieved by name, keyword, references and annotation. All sequence and annotation data are also available for download.

* The miRBase Registry provides miRNA gene hunters with unique names for novel miRNA genes prior to publication of results. Visit the help pages for more information about the naming service.

## Name

The names in the database are of the form hsa-mir-121b. The first three letters signify the organism. The mir/miR part of the name denote the precursor and the mature sequence respectively. Identical mature sequences from distinct precursors will get names of the form hsa-miR-121-1 and hsa-miR-121-2, while highly similar sequences will have the form hsa-miR-121a and hsa-miR-121b. Finally, different organisms have slightly different naming conventions. For example, in plants published names are of the form MIR121. We try wherever possible to stick to these conventions.

## Accession Number

In addition to a name or ID, each miRBase Sequence entry has a unique accession number. The accession number is the only truly stable identifier for an entry -- miRNA names may change from those published as relationships between sequences become clear. The advantage of the accessioned system is that such changes can be tracked in the database, allowing names to evolve to remain consistent, whilst providing the user with full access to the data and history. However, accessions convey little biological meaning, and it is expected that miRNAs are referred to by name in publications.

## Information

This page contains information about the miRNA gene of interest and depicts the precusor sequence with the mature miRNA sequence highlighted. The folded precursor structure is computed using the RNAfold program from the ViennaRNA suite. Limitations of the ascii depiction mean that for complex structures, such as some of the plant precursors, only base pairing interactions of the first helix are shown. The entry table also contains links to publications describing the identification of the miRNA.

To receive email notification of data updates and feature changes please subscribe to the miRBase announcements mailing list. Any queries about the website or naming service should be directed at mirbase@manchester.ac.uk.

miRBase is managed by the Griffiths-Jones lab at the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester with funding from the BBSRC. miRBase was previously hosted and supported by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
