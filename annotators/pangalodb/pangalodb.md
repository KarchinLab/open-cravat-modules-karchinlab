# PangaloDB
PanglaoDB is a database for the scientific community interested in exploration of single cell RNA sequencing experiments from mouse and human. We collect and integrate data from multiple studies and present them through a unified framework. The goal of this database is to provide easy access and exploration of single cell RNA sequencing experiments. All data used in this database are public.

PanglaoDB contains pre-processed and pre-computed analyses from more than 1054 single-cell experiments covering most major single cell platforms and protocols, based on more than 4 million cells from a wide range of tissues and organs. The online interface allows users to query and explore cell types, genetic pathways and regulatory networks. In addition, we have established a community-curated cell-type marker compendium, containing more than 6000 gene-cell-type associations, as a resource for automatic annotation of cell types.
