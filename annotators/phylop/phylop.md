# phyloP 100 Way Vertebrate & phyloP 20 Way Mammalian: conservation scoring by phylogenetic p-values
The phyloP database contains conservation scoring by phyloP (phylogenetic p-values) for multiple alignments of 99 vertebrate genomes to the human genome as well as for multiple alignments of 19 mammalian genome sequences to the human genome.

NOTE: Data provided by [dbNSFP](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP) version 3.5a

1. 100 Way Vertebrate phyloP (phylogenetic p-values) conservation score based on the multiple alignments of 100 vertebrate genomes (including human). The larger the score, the more conserved the site. Scores range from -20.0 to 10.003 in the database.
2. 100 Way Vertebrate scores were ranked among all 100 Way Vertevrate scores in the database. The rankscore is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of 100 Way Vertebrate scores in the database.
3. 20 Way Mammalian phyloP (phylogenetic p-values) conservation score based on the multiple alignments of 20 mammalian genomes (including human). The larger the score, the more conserved the site. Scores range from -13.282 to 1.199 in the database.
4. 20 Way Mammalian scores were ranked among all 20 Way Mammalian scores in the database. The rankscore is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of 20 Way Mammalian scores in the database.
