        binary classification is 0.5 for HDIV score or 0.38028 for rankscore, i.e. the

        if the HDIV score is larger than 0.5.

  desc: Max rank score across all transcripts. PolyPhen-2 HDIV scores were first ranked among all HDIV scores.
        The rankscore is the ratio of the rank the score over the total number of the
        scores. If there are multiple scores, only the most damaging rankscore
        is presented.
