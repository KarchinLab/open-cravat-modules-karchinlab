  title: HDIV Rank Score
  type: float
  desc: Polyphen2 HDIV scores were first ranked among all HDIV scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is the ratio of the rank the score over the total number of the scores in dbNSFP. If there are multiple scores, only the most damaging (largest) rankscore is presented. The scores range from 0.03061 to 0.91137.

  title: HDIV Prediction
  type: string
  desc: Polyphen2 prediction based on HumDiv, "D" ("probably damaging", HDIV score in [0.957,1] or rankscore in [0.55859,0.91137]), "P" ("possibly damaging", HDIV score in [0.454,0.956] or rankscore in [0.37043,0.55681]) and "B" ("benign", HDIV score in [0,0.452] or rankscore in [0.03061,0.36974]). Score cutoff for binary classification is 0.5 for HDIV score or 0.38028 for rankscore, i.e. the prediction is "neutral" if the HDIV score is smaller than 0.5 (rankscore is smaller than 0.38028), and "deleterious" if the HDIV score is larger than 0.5 (rankscore is larger than 0.38028). Multiple entries are separated by ";", corresponding to Uniprot_acc.
