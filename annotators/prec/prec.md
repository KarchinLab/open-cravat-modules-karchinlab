# Probability of recessive disease P(rec): providing probabilities for LoF alleles
P(rec) provides a database identifying rare and likely deleterious loss-of-function (LoF) alleles, including 26 known and 21 predicted severe diseaseâ€“causing variants, as well as common LoF variants in nonessential genes. 

NOTE: Data provided by [dbNSFP](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP) version 3.5a

1. P(rec): Estimated probability that gene is a recessive disease gene
2. Known Status: Known recessive status of the gene. 
    * lof-tolerant: seen in homozygous state in at least one 1000G individual
    * recessive: known OMIM recessive disease.
