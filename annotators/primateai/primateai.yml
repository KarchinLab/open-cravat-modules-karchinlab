  title: Score 
  type: float
  hidden: false
  width: 80
  desc: A pathogenicity prediction score for missense variants based on common variants of non-human primate species using a deep neural network. The range of PrimateAI score is 0 to 1. The larger the score, the more likely the variant is pathogenic.

  title: Prediction
  type: string
  hidden: true
  width: 90
  desc: Prediction of PrimateAI score based on the authors' recommendation, "T(olerated)" or "D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.803.
