# PROVEAN 

(Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) is a software tool which predicts whether an amino acid substitution or indel has an impact on the biological function of a protein.

PROVEAN is useful for filtering sequence variants to identify nonsynonymous or indel variants that are predicted to be functionally important.

The performance of PROVEAN is comparable to popular tools such as SIFT or PolyPhen-2.

A fast computation approach to obtain pairwise sequence alignment scores enabled the generation of precomputed PROVEAN predictions for 20 single AA substitutions and a single AA deletion at every amino acid position of all protein sequences.
