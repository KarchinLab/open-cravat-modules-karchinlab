output_columns:
- name: ra
  title: Rank
  type: string
  desc: Lower scores indicate increasing evidence for a variant to be located in a functional region.
        Category 1 variants are likely to affect binding and linked to expression of a gene target.
        Category 2 variants are likely to affect binding. Category 3 are less likely to affect binding.
        Categories > 3 variants have minimal binding evidence.

- name: tf_binding
  title: TF Binding
  type: string
  desc: TF binding is predicted from DNase footprints, results indicate a specific DNA-protein interaction and event, and increases the confidence that the variant is functional.

  title: DNase Peak
  type: string
  desc: Whether this SNV falls into the region of DNase-seq peaks.
