  title: Score
  type: float
  desc: Ranges from 0 to 1. The amino acid substitution is predicted damaging is the score is <= 0.05, and tolerated if the score is > 0.05. 
  hidden: true
- name: med
  title: Median Info
  type: float
  desc: Ranges from 0 to 4.32, ideally the number would be between 2.75 and 3.5. This is used to measure the diversity of the sequences used for prediction. A value over 3.25 indicates that the prediction was based on closely related sequences.
  hidden: true
- name: seqs
  title: Seqs at Position
  type: int
  desc: This is the number of sequences that have an amino acid at the position of prediction. SIFT automatically chooses the sequence for you, but if the substitution is located at the beginning or end of the protein, there may be only a few sequences represented at that position, and this column indicates this.
