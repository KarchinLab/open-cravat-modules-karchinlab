# SiPhy: A database of conservation scores based on 29 mammal genomes
The Broad Institute has sequenced 15 mammals, while two other centers have sequenced the other 9 mammals. We have developed algorithms to identify regions of sequence similarity across species, which have persisted through evolution and are indicative of genomic functionality. These regions include genes and smaller regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, which play key roles in determining the activation of genes and pathways in different cellular contexts.
