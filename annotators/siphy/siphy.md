# SiPhy: A database of conservation scores based on 29 mammal genomes
The Broad Institute has sequenced 15 mammals, while two other centers have sequenced the other 9 mammals. We have developed algorithms to identify regions of sequence similarity across species, which have persisted through evolution and are indicative of genomic functionality. These regions include genes and smaller regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, which play key roles in determining the activation of genes and pathways in different cellular contexts.

1. Stationary Distribution: The estimated stationary distribution of A, C, G and T at the site, using SiPhy algorithm based on 29 mammals genomes.
2. Score: SiPhy score based on 29 mammals genomes. The larger the score, the more conserved the site. Scores range from 0 to 37.9718 in the database.
3. Rank Score: SiPhy scores were ranked among all scores in the database. The rankscore is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of scores in the database.
