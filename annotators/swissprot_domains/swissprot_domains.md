# Swiss-Prot Domains
Information on sequence similarities with other proteins and the domain(s) present in a protein. In addition to information on the location and the topology of the mature protein in the cell.

The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

|Subsection|Content|
|----------|:------|
|[Domain](https://www.uniprot.org/help/domain)|	Denotes the position and type of each modular protein domain|
|[Repeat](https://www.uniprot.org/help/repeat)| Denotes the positions of repeated sequence motifs or repeated domains|
|[Motif](https://www.uniprot.org/help/motif)| Short (up to 20 amino acids) sequence motif of biological interest|
|[Peptide](https://www.uniprot.org/help/peptide)| Position and length of an active peptide in the mature protein.|
|[Transmembrane](https://www.uniprot.org/help/transmem)| Extent of a membrane-spanning region|
|[Topological Domain](https://www.uniprot.org/help/topo_dom)| Location of non-membrane regions of membrane-spanning proteins|
|[Intramembrane](https://www.uniprot.org/help/intramem)| Extent of a region located in a membrane without crossing it|
