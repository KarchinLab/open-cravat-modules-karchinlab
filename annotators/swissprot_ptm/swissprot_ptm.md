# Swissprot PTMs

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is the manually annotated and reviewed section of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB).
It is a high quality annotated and non-redundant protein sequence database, which brings together experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions.

Swiss-Prot has a subsection 'PTM / Processing' that describes post-transitional modifications (PTMs). This subsection complements the information provided at the sequence level or describes modifications for which position-specific data is not yet available.

## PTMs

* A post-translational modification is a covalent processing event resulting from a proteolytic cleavage or from the addition of a modifying group to one amino acid. They modulate the function of most eukaryote proteins by altering their activity state, localization, turnover, and interactions with other proteins. 

* Although proteins can be modified pre-, co- or post-translationally, all protein modifications are generally referred to as PTMs, because a majority of them are made post-translationally, after the protein is folded.

## Modified Residue

* This subsection of the 'PTM / Processing' section specifies the position and type of each modified residue excluding lipids, glycans and protein cross-links.

* Common modifications include phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, amidation, formation of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, isomerization, hydroxylation, sulfation, flavin-binding, cysteine oxidation and nitrosylation.

* We describe the chemical nature of the modified residue using a controlled vocabulary (see the document ['Controlled vocabulary of posttranslational modifications (PTM)')](https://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist).

### We provide additional information concerning the modification, such as:

* The enzyme which carries out the modification. For proteins of infectious organisms, such as viruses, phages and bacteria, we also indicate whether the modification is carried out by a host protein.

* The Relationship with another feature ('partial', 'alternate', 'transient'). The term 'partial' indicates that not all protein molecules are modified, 'alternate' means that the same amino acid can be modified in more than one way, and 'transient' is applied to exceptional cases of otherwise stable modifications. For partial modifications, we do not propagate this comment to homologous proteins and we do not specify the fraction of proteins modified, as this may depend on the experimental conditions.
