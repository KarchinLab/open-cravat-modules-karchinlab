# Swissprot PTMs

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is the manually annotated and reviewed section of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB).
It is a high quality annotated and non-redundant protein sequence database, which brings together experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions.

Swiss-Prot has a subsection 'PTM / Processing' that describes post-transitional modifications (PTMs). This subsection complements the information provided at the sequence level or describes modifications for which position-specific data is not yet available.
