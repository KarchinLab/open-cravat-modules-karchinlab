# VARITY

The success of personalized genomic medicine depends on our ability to assess the pathogenicity of rare human variants, including the important class of missense variation. There are many challenges in training accurate computational systems, e.g., in finding the balance between quantity, quality, and bias in the variant sets used as training examples and avoiding predictive features that can accentuate the effects of bias. Here, we describe VARITY, which judiciously exploits a larger reservoir of training examples with uncertain accuracy and representativity. To limit circularity and bias, VARITY excludes features informed by variant annotation and protein identity. To provide a rationale for each prediction, we quantified the contribution of features and feature combinations to the pathogenicity inference of each variant. VARITY outperformed all previous computational methods evaluated, identifying at least 10% more pathogenic variants at thresholds achieving high (90% precision) stringency.

The VARITY approach for pathogenicity prediction, which has been specifically optimized for rare missense variation. While VARITY uses a meta-prediction strategy, it limits the circularity that can arise in such approaches by excluding any feature that was informed by variant pathogenicity annotation. We also exclude features that may serve as proxies for protein identity because these may lead to predictions that are biased by the fraction of each proteinâ€™s variants in the training set that are annotated pathogenic (which may be inaccurate in future application settings). VARITY judiciously harnesses a larger set of training examples with uncertain accuracy and representativity and uses differential weighting strategies to ensure that training set expansion improves performance on a high-quality test set.
