#Genetic data is provided below as five TAB delimited columns.  Each line 
#corresponds to a SNP.  Column one provides the SNP identifier (rsID where 
#possible).  Columns two and three contain the chromosome and basepair position 
#of the SNP using human reference build 37.1 coordinates.  Columns four and five 
#contain the two alleles observed at this SNP (genotype).  The genotype is reported 
#on the forward (+) strand with respect to the human reference.
