description: CHASMplus is a machine learning algorithm that discriminates somatic
  missense mutations as either cancer drivers or passengers. Predictions can be done
  in either a cancer type-specific manner or by a model considering multiple cancer
  types together (a useful default). Along with scoring each mutation, CHASMplus has
  a rigorous statistical model to evaluate the statistical significance of predictions.
  This OpenCRAVAT module represents the v1.0 precompute of CHASMplus (source code
  v1.0).
