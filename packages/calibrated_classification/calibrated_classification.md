# Calibrated Classification: Package for clinical interpretation of variant effect predictor scores

The ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group reccommends that calibrated scores from select 
variant effect predictors are reliable as Strong, NA, Moderate, or Supporting evidence for Pathogenicity (PP3) 
or Benignity (BP4) within ACMG/AMP Guidelines (Pejaver, Vikas et al. “Calibration of computational tools 
for missense variant pathogenicity classification and ClinGen recommendations for PP3/BP4 criteria.”
